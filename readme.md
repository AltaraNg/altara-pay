# Ionic 4 Auth CLI

Starting point for Ionic 4 Application with Authentication build in.

## Getting Started

If your Ionic 4 application needs authentication, you have came on right page. If you are starting a completely new project, then you can just clone this and start working on it. This will save your couple of hours for sure.

In this Project Iâ€™m using side menu template of Ionic 4. If you already have a project then you can go to [Ionic Auth](https://github.com/flicher-net/ionic-4-auth) and copy only files.


### Prerequisites

[Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/)

[Node](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

If you want to install the project local, you can using following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/flicher-net/ionic-4-auth-cli.git
```

CD into project

```
cd ionic-4-auth-cli/
```

Install Node Modules

If you are using mac, you might get ENFILE: file table overflow errors, you can use these commands to solve it.

```
echo kern.maxfiles=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
ulimit -n 65536 65536
