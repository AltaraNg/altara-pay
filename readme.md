# Ionic 4 Auth CLI

Starting point for Ionic 4 Application with Authentication build in.

## Getting Started

If your Ionic 4 application needs authentication, you have came on right page. If you are starting a completely new project, then you can just clone this and start working on it. This will save your couple of hours for sure.

In this Project Iâ€™m using side menu template of Ionic 4. If you already have a project then you can go to [Ionic Auth](https://github.com/flicher-net/ionic-4-auth) and copy only files.
